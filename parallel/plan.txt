* Parallel MPI Engine *
* http://mpi4py.scipy.org/

* Timeouts generally
* Test apps
- Calc density
- Calc models

+ Setup queues properly
- More jobs than cores
! Extra jobs are skipped at present
- Possibly inhomogeneous
- Concept of free slots
- Engine can poll Controller for status

+ Non-waiting callback function
* Test when Worker and Controller processes killed

? Asynchromous recieve - not much gain
? MPI alternative to discrete pings?
? Remote Workers


MPI recv 100% cpu
--mca mpi_yield_when_idle 1
